# guestList
The guestList is the next part of the firebaseAuth(https://github.com/shivprakash1997/firebaseAuth) project.
In this project, the person at the registration desk can scan the qrCode of the invited person and check if they were invited and mark their presence in the database.

The database that we are using in this project is the Realtime Database by Firebase. The project is made using HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap.

The qrcode reading and decoding part is done with help of instascan by Chris Schmich (https://github.com/schmich/instascan/releases).

All you have to do is to first go to firebaseAuth(https://github.com/shivprakash1997/firebaseAuth) and follow the steps given there. After that go to fKeys,js and fill all the XXXXXXXXXXX with the keys that you get from firebase. Then go to index.html and you are good to go.
